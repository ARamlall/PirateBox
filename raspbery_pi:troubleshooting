Technical FAQ
Enabling PirateBox for startup seems not to work.
Some USB Sticks take a while until they are available. PirateBox Scripts try initialize the wifi card directly. If the card is not available, it can be useful to enable a wait-time until the device become available. To enable this device-polling run

sed -i 's|PROBE_INTERFACE="no"|PROBE_INTERFACE="yes"|g' /opt/piratebox/conf/piratebox.conf
The next reboot should work. If not, please report back to the forums.


PirateBox does not work after system upgrade
The PirateBox RaspberryPi images are Archlinux based. In case you want to install additional software, it might be handy to run the upgrade commands:

pacman -Syu
Sometimes the packages changes, so recently the dnsmasq package will now auto enable itself. So make sure that dnsmasq is properly disabled and stopped after installing your software:

systemctl stop dnsmasq
systemctl disable dnsmasq
You might consider restarting PirateBox after your activities:

systemctl restart piratebox
